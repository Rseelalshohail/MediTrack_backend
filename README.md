# MediTrack Backend 

## üåü Project Description

MediTrack is a full-stack medical device management system designed for hospitals and clinical environments. It enables engineers, nurses, and administrators to manage medical equipment, work orders, and spare part requests through a secure, role-based interface. The backend is built with Django and Django REST Framework, supporting robust APIs, user authentication (JWT), and multi-role access logic.

## üîπ Repository Description

This repository contains the backend of the MediTrack project. It handles API endpoints, database models, business logic, and JWT-based authentication for three user types (Admin, Engineer, Nurse).
